# Data-Driven Marketing

The notes are from the book [Data Driven Marketing: The 15 Metrics Everyone in Marketing Should know](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470504544?pf_rd_r=F9NZM2S7PX0FNVWB1072&pf_rd_p=5ae2c7f8-e0c6-4f35-9071-dc3240e894a8&pd_rd_r=4f85b275-6ee6-49d0-bc5a-db6b2d8bfe01&pd_rd_w=Y9BWu&pd_rd_wg=7aXzx&ref_=pd_gw_unk).  The book is divided into three parts: 

*   Part 1: The Essentials
*   Part 2: 15 Metrics to Radically Improve Marketing Performance
*   Part 3: The Next Level 

In the first part, the 15 metrics are introduced which are then talked about in greater detail in part two while the part three builds more on the second part. 

## Part 1: The Essentials

The approach of this book is to focus on a framework for marketing measurement, balanced scorecards with few key metrics that point to value, and approaches for analysis that are relatively straightforward to implement. 

### The 15 Essential Marketing Metrics

The 15 essential metrics for marketing are the following: 

1.  Brand awareness
2.  Test-drive
3.  Churn
4.  Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
5.  Take rate
6.  Profit
7.  Net present value (NPV)
8.  Internal rate of return (IRR)
9.  Payback
10.  Customer lifetime value (CLTV)
11.  Cost per click (CPC)
12.  Transaction conversion rate (TCR)
13.  Return on ad dollars spent (ROA)
14.  Bounce rate
15.  Word of month (WOM)

Here are few things to note about these 15 metrics: 

*   The first 10 are **classical marketing metrics**.
*    Metrics 1 - 5 are **nonfinancial metrics**. They define the efficacy of branding, customer loyalty, comparative marketing activities, and marketing campaign performance.
*   Metrics 6 - 9 are the **essential financial metrics**.
*   The 10th metric, CLTV, is the essential financial metric for customer value-based decision making.
*   Metrics 11-15 are known as the **new-age metrics**. These metrics are used in the age of internet. 

Let's start the journey with a few general case exampels of data-driven marketing and how to use marketing metrics in practice. 

*   Use of personalized letters to targeted customers. Letter are often thrown out and with an increasing cost of printing and delivering, letters can be made a useful tool through personalization. For example, addressing the letter with a person's name. Asking them to connect to the internet with a personalized URL. This encourages the user to login in and the marketer to track the effectiveness of the tool. 

*   Customization allows increased ROI. For example, targeting Porche owners or potential buyers to personalize their new car can significantly increase sales.

*   The Sears company would send out catalogues of their inventory to customers all over the country. The catalogues were customized by region. So, people in the midwest would get the same catalogue while people in the south would get a different one. The total marketing cost was \$250M while it drove an incremental revenue of \$900M. If we assume the margins for retail in the U.S. is 10%, we see that even when the catalogues were driving revenue to \$900M, the company was losing about \$100M per year. 
    To address this issue, Sears decide to segment the market for better targeted direct-mailing marketing. With today's technology, through data mining we can create more fine-grained segmentation. Sears created 25 segments based on various variables, attributes, and purchase characteristics. The products and categories were then targets based on these segments. Furthermore, they eliminated the strict cutoff that included only the top 40% of customers, and instead captured "upsell" opportunities among lower-value customers with upside potential. 
    This increased their revenue from \$900M to \$1.1B. People who recieved the mailer came to the store more and when at the store bought more. But more importantly, the mailers generated the "Ah,  that's exactly what I need" effect.

    >   The "Ah, that's exactly what I need" effect is when you show a customer the product they want when they need it are more likely to purchase it and you don't have to put the product on sale.

    The change Sears did was just 2% improvement in gross margins but given millions of customers, it is a huge financial impact. 

### Section Summary

*   Data-driven marketing in its simplest form is "keeping score" which enables justification of marketing investments. Keeping scores helps to understand what works and doesn't work. This ensure the marketing dollars are invested that yield higher returns. 
*   At the next level, the use of analytics in marketing can dramatically improve performance.
